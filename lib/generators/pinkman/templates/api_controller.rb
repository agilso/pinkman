  # --- Settings scope in client
  
  # You can set params[:scope] value directly in the client (js/coffee). 
  # By default, every pinkman requests is made with the 'public' scope. See bellow how to change this behaviour.

  # 1. In a single object/collection
  # obj = new Pinkman.object; obj.set('scope','your_scope')

  # 2. In all instances of a given model (object or collection)
  # class YourModel extends Pinkman.object
  # YourModel.scope = 'your_scope'

  # 3. In all instances through AppObject and AppCollection
  # AppObject.scope = 'your_scope'
  # AppCollection.scope = 'your_scope'
